### Acknowledegment

- The aim of our project is to get a better understanding of the usage of Deep Learning for Bangla Handwriting Recognition through replicating an existing research paper. So we replicated the approach used in [LILA-BOTI : Leveraging Isolated Letter Accumulations By Ordering Teacher Insights for Bangla Handwriting Recognition](https://github.com/apurba-nsu-rnd-lab/lila-boti)
